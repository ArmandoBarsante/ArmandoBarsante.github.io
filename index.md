Iâ€™m a collaborative conservation scientist translating satellite telemetry and risk modeling into management-ready decisions for wildlife, with an emphasis on marine megafauna. I partner with universities, NGOs, and agencies across the globe to co-produce actionable science and clear map-based products. Fluent in Portuguese and English. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University working with the [Marine Turtle Research and Conservation Group](https://marineturtleresearch.com) with 20+ years of sea turtle conservation experience in Brazil and more recently in the United States. I help teams with study design, modeling, and communicating results that matter for management.

Services
- Tracking & data: Satellite tagging (Argos or GPS), data processing, and quality control.
- Spatial ecology: Habitat-use and behavior modeling; home-range estimation via autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models (dBBMM); identification of migratory corridors and critical habitats.
- Risk & impact: Spatial overlap with vessels, fisheries, and other pressures; mitigation scenario testing; environmental impact assessment (EIA) support.
- Quantitative modeling: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), generalized additive models (GAM), state-space and movement models; abundance and population estimation.
- Fieldwork & permitting: Study design and protocols; permits and compliance; drone-based wildlife surveys.
- Decision support & communication: Technical/scientific reports; maps and dashboards; stakeholder engagement and outreach.

  
I have led and collaborated on multi-species conservation projects from study design through publication. By applying a broad spatial-ecology toolkit, my work clarifies how human pressures shape habitat use and delivers targeted, actionable mitigation guidance.

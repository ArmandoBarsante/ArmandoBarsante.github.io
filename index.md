I am a scientist in the [Marine Turtle Research and Conservation Group](https://marineturtleresearch.com) with over two decades of experience in sea turtle conservation projects across Brazil and the United States.

I offer specialized services in:

- Satellite tracking of marine fauna (telemetry)
- Spatial analysis of habitat use and animal behavior
- Delineation of migratory corridors and critical conservation areas
- Environmental impact assessments and overlap with risk sources
- Preparation of technical and scientific reports
- Statistical modeling and ecological interpretation of tracking data
- Study design and implementation of ecological fieldwork
- Wildlife abundance and population estimates
- Drone-based surveys for wildlife monitoring
- Environmental permitting and compliance support
- Science communication and community outreach

  
I have been involved in the design, implementation, analysis, and publication of conservation projects focused on multiple sea turtle species. My work integrates a wide range of tools for spatial ecology, including Bayesian modeling and dive pattern analysis, to better understand how habitat use is shaped by anthropogenic impacts.

Scientist in the [Marine Turtle Research and Conservation Group](https://marineturtleresearch.com) with 20+ years of sea turtle conservation experience in Brazil and the United States.

I offer specialized services in:

- Satellite tracking of marine fauna (telemetry)
- Spatial analysis of habitat use and animal behavior
- Delineation of migratory corridors and critical conservation areas
- Environmental impact assessments and overlap with risk sources
- Preparation of technical and scientific reports
- Statistical modeling and ecological interpretation of tracking data
- Study design and implementation of ecological fieldwork
- Wildlife abundance and population estimates
- Drone-based surveys for wildlife monitoring
- Environmental permitting and compliance support
- Science communication and community outreach

  
I have led and collaborated on conservation projects involving multiple sea turtle species, encompassing the design, implementation, analysis, and publication of findings. By applying a wide array of spatial ecology tools, my work aims to better understand how human-induced pressures affect habitat use and to inform targeted mitigation efforts.
